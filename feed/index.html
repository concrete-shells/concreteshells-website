            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3D printing has become a trend in recent years; everyone seems to be aware of
                the technology in some way, whether they saw it on TV or read about it online. There is tons of hype
                over the ability to manufacture one solid piece of material onsite, supposedly leading to the
                decentralization of manufacturing. However, much of this hype is due to a widespread misunderstanding of
                the technology and its limitations. Many people have seen promotional videos and articles sporting
                titles like “3D Printed Concrete Home for Only $10,000” and “3D Printed Concrete Home Able to Withstand
                8.0 Earthquakes”, but all of these pieces of content only ever show one side of the picture. Yes, 3D
                printing could be hugely effective in homing people when natural disaster strikes, but in terms of using
                the technology for your next new build, the technology falls short in many ways.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3D Printed Homes Do Not Use Reinforced Concrete</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Concrete has extraordinary compressive strength, but weak tensile strength. Simply put, it is very
                    difficult to crush concrete, but much easier to pull it apart. Embedding steel bars (AKA rebar) into
                    the concrete creates “Reinforced Concrete”- ultimately making the concrete tougher to pull apart.
                    Without rebar to reinforce the concrete, concrete is not a suitable material for Bay Area home
                    building.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Incorporation of Remaining Trades is Difficult</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Having a home made entirely out of concrete poses a huge issue: How do you finish out the rest of the
                    trades? Nailing to concrete is no easy task. How does one go about turning what begins as a bunker,
                    into a home? A Concrete Shell has a non-structural wood interior that covers this issue, but 3D
                    printed homes cannot easily complete the remaining trades.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Creates a “Lego Wall” Structure</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>3D printing uses a layer by layer manufacturing technique. This is their greatest attribute but also
                    their largest issue. The layers mean that the structure has laminate weaknesses (AKA the layers do
                    not stick together as well on the vertical axis as they do on the horizontal axis). This creates a
                    “Lego Wall” situation, where the structure feels strong when you press down on it, but weak and
                    fragile when you push the wall from the side.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Work Hours Limitation Creates Cold Joints</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many companies with 3D printing technology boast extremely rapid completion times such as “3D Printed
                    Concrete Home Manufactured in 24 Hours”. This would be really cool, except for the United States has
                    several laws that ban construction work at night. Thus, the 3D printing machine could only run for a
                    set amount of hours during the day. Since you would not be able to work all 24 hours straight
                    through, your structure’s concrete would have cold joints. Using basic terms, the concrete hardened
                    to much before all of the concrete was able to be poured.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Site Preparation</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>I can 100% guarantee you that the companies advertising “3D Printed Concrete Home for Only $10,000”
                    did not include excavation and foundation work. A huge expense in putting up any new structure is
                    preparing the site for the new structure. The foundation is what ultimately determines the strength
                    of a structure; because a Concrete Shell monolithically casts the foundation with the entire home,
                    the site preparation goes hand in hand and is included in the price.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>Based on the above information, Concrete Shells has no choice but to FAIL 3D Printed Concrete
                    Homes. We absolutely love the idea of manufacturing a home on site and being able to quickly provide
                    shelter to those in need during hard times, but all of these downsides make this technology
                    impractical for Bay Area residential building.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building a new home can be a particularly daunting task for many people. This
                is especially true when dealing with the strict laws and regulations that come with building a new home
                in California. Concrete Shells wants to make sure that our clients possess basic knowledge on California
                construction law in order to better prepare them for what to expect when building their new home. Below
                is a brief run through of the top things you should know about California construction law before
                building your next home. Please leave us a comment if this helped you out!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is a Mechanic’s Lien Release?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A mechanic&#8217;s lien is a security interest in the title to property for the benefit of those who
                    have supplied labor or materials that improve the property. The lien exists for both real property
                    and personal property. Parties entitled to mechanic’s lien rights in California include direct
                    contractors,  subcontractors, material suppliers, equipment lessors, laborers, design professionals,
                    and any person providing work authorized for a site improvement. For all parties, it is required
                    that the party provided work authorized for a work of improvement.</p>
                <p>No lien release is binding unless the claimant signs and delivers a waiver and release. If signed by
                    the claimant or his or her authorized agent, the signed form is effective to release the affected
                    party from liability.</p>
                <p><u>Friendly Tip</u>: Be careful! Paying your contractor (and/or getting a release from your
                    contractor) does not guarantee that other claimants, like subcontractors and suppliers, are paid. A
                    claimant is a person who, if not paid, can file a lien on your property. To be effective, the waiver
                    and release forms must follow, substantially, one of the forms set forth in Civil Code sections
                    8132, 8134, 8136, and 8138.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Did you know there is a 3 Day Right of Rescission for a Signed Contract?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Federal Trade Commission gives you the right to cancel a contract for a full refund until
                    midnight of the third business day after the sale. The seller must inform the consumer of his/her
                    rights to cancel or rescind the contract at the time of sale. You do not have to give a reason for
                    canceling, as you have the right to change your mind. The seller has ten business days to cancel and
                    return any check you signed, or ultimately refund all your money.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always Follow the First Rule of Hollywood: Get it In Writing!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any work valued at over $500 must be in writing and must be done by a licensed contractor. If you are
                    promised something verbally, make sure that it is included in writing. Don&#8217;t sign anything
                    until you understand the contract and agree to the terms. Trusting someone’s word (even if friend or
                    family) is not advisable in a situation like this.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can I be proactive to avoid accidentally breaking construction laws?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To be proactive, always follow the first rule of Hollywood.</p>
                <p>DO NOT USE UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS!</p>
                <p>Go with your “gut feeling”. If something feels a little off or abnormal, it probably is! Do your
                    research if something does not seem correct.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Did you know you are automatically protected for the future?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A one year warranty is required on all work completed, and a ten year warranty on latent defects is
                    required on items that cannot be directly seen (such as structural items).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where can I go to learn more about these laws?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To learn more, check out the Contractors State License Board website: <a
                        href="http://www.cslb.ca.gov">www.cslb.ca.gov</a> and the Federal Trade Commission <a

            </description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly half a decade of drought, California has been dealing with an
                extremely active wildfire season prompting a state of emergency. As of August 27th, the California
                Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported that there have been 4,270 fires across California
                this year, scorching more than 387,000 acres of land. Wildfires have become a major problem in
                California in recent years, stealing beautiful homes, sentimental possessions, and loved ones as they
                pass through. Personal items and property can be replaced, but the CDFFP notes that 7 people have
                already lost their lives this year as of August 6th to forest fire. Wildfires are destructive but
                unfortunately inevitable, so it is time that society focus on reducing their ability to spread.</p>
                <p>Home ignition is a huge contributing factor to the spread of wildfire. This is largely attributed to
                    the fact that most homes are built out of wood frame. With so much devastation happening in our own
                    backyards, homebuyers and builders alike need to take more care in choosing the best materials to
                    build their homes out of- especially in areas prone to wildfire. Using a fire resistant material
                    such as concrete to build homes can drastically change how wildfires spread and how much of your
                    home is still standing after the damage has been done. This is one of many safety advantages to
                    living in a concrete house.</p>
                <p>Simply put, concrete does not catch fire like wood and many other building materials. While concrete
                    technically does not burn, it will begin to break down under extreme conditions. In order to test
                    this, solid concrete walls were exposed to continuous gas flames and temperatures of up to 2000°F
                    for as long as four hours ₁. None of the insulating concrete forms or concrete walls failed
                    structurally ₁. In contrast, wood frame walls typically collapsed in an hour or less ₁. Keeping in
                    mind that the average surface fire on the forest floor can reach temperatures of 1,472°F, this seems
                    like a much more suitable material for home building, as wood will burst into flame at a mere 572°F
                    ₃. Under the most severe wildfire conditions, flame temperatures may exceed 2,192°F; a temperature
                    that still may not compromise the structural integrity of a concrete home ₂.</p>
                <p>Concrete has also proven more resistant to spreading fire from one side of a wall to the other. In
                    fact, concrete walls are frequently used in multi-family structures to block a fire from spreading
                    into adjacent units. During testing, concrete walls did not permit flames to pass directly through,
                    nor did it allow sufficient radiant heat to start the fire on the other side for 2 to 4 hours ₁.
                    Unfortunately when it comes to wood framing, they allow both flame and fire-starting heat through
                    the walls in an hour or less ₁.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, it is important to consider building your next home out of concrete in order to reduce
                    the fire&#8217;s impact on your community and better protect your family and valued possessions
                    against wildfire.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are in an office building or personal residence, it is important to
                feel safe and secure when inside of a structure. What would you do if right this very second, an
                earthquake hit? A massive fire ignited? A tornado was en route towards you? Would you be worried? What
                would you do? In most cases, when a natural disaster strikes, there is not much you can do. You would
                need to face the fact that your office building or home could be completely destroyed, and only hope
                that no human casualties will occur. This makes one wonder- In a country defined by the advancement of
                technology, why are we not building safer, more secure structures? We live in a world that is marked by
                climate change and more frequent, more severe, natural threats. Why are we not building homes and
                commercial properties that are prepared for this? Why are we still relying on ancient building practices
                to handle these advancing threats?</p>
                <h2>Did you know?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), there are about 475,000 total
                        structures lost to fire every year in the U.S.
                    </li>
                    <li>The NEIC (National Earthquake Information Center) reports that there are approximately 20,000
                        earthquakes every year (about 50 a day) around the world.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each year in the U.S., 1,200 tornadoes on average kill 60 people, injure 1,500, and cause
                        roughly $400 million in damages, putting long-term average tornado losses on par with
                        hurricanes, according to a new report by Lloyd’s of London.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sollars Home will lead a new wave in housing that sees concrete displace wood as a more safe and
                    sustainable global housing option. We truly respect the unyielding power of Mother Nature.
                    Therefore, we have engineered extremely safe buildings that are resistant against the forces of
                    nature. Here are some things to keep in mind when building your next home:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Concrete will begin to break down under extreme conditions, but it technically does not burn or
                        catch fire. In fact, concrete walls are frequently used in multi-family structures to block a
                        fire from spreading into adjacent units.
                    </li>
                    <li>During an earthquake, the shaking of the ground is not what causes the most human fatalities; it
                        is the associated destruction of man-made structures and the instigation of other natural
                        disasters. If your home was built out of one solid piece of concrete, like a Sollars Home, it
                        would be extremely difficult for it to collapse in an earthquake.
                    </li>
                    <li>A 1,500 square foot home cast entirely out of concrete would weigh upwards of 650,000 pounds.
                        There is no tornado in history with wind power high enough to remove this building from its
                        location.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Concrete is a material proven to stand the test of time and we are proud to be a company committed to
                    the safety of our building’s inhabitants and improving the health of our planet through sustainable
                    practices. Sollars Home has set out to build concrete structures that will make natural disasters
                    far less frightening, and dealing with the aftermath far less costly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over time, man has used a variety of materials to create his living space,
                which paints a picture of our ­ongoing quest to make long-lasting structures that meet our changing
                needs. The evolution of architecture works to meet these challenges and handles the cultural perception
                of what those buildings should look like and how they should be used. But structurally, this asks an
                important question: What material is the best for building homes here in the Bay Area? What material
                will stand up to the next Silicon Valley earthquake? Santa Cruz Mountain fire? Here we evaluate
                different home building materials to declare a winner of the battle for best material!</p>
                <p>WOOD</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO: It can be used as a primary material, as seen in log cabin construction or blended with
                        other building materials and used as either a decorative element or support structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>PRO: Wood has an excellent strength to weight ratio and can be cut to length easily.</li>
                    <li>PRO: Wood is lightweight and plentiful, plus the look and ‘feel’ of wood is a very popular
                        aesthetic in the Bay Area.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: Wood decays over time, and it&#8217;s vulnerable to moisture damage like dry rot and
                        predation by insects like termites.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: Earthquake, fire, flood, and high wind can more easily take down a wooden structure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>BRICK</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO: Some like the visual appeal and aesthetics of brick walls. Experimentation led to the
                        development of forms and molds to create uniform bricks that could be stacked easily for smooth
                        walls with clean corners.
                    </li>
                    <li>PRO: Bricks are durable, weather resistant, fire resistant, easy to make and convenient to work
                        with.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: Brick is very vulnerable to earthquakes. In old brick buildings with no interior frame, an
                        earthquake could quickly bring down the walls and the roof. In modern day buildings, the
                        building is held in place by a steel frame, but some bricks may still fall in a quake.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: Brick is not a good insulator, which means that cold air from the outside will transfer
                        into the house. So brick houses will not perform as well in the northern CA climate unless the
                        frame walls are insulated.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>STONE</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO: Where there are resources available to excavate and cut it precisely, stone can be an
                        extremely strong and useful natural material.
                    </li>
                    <li>PRO: Unlike brick, it can be stacked without mortar and support heavy vertical loads.</li>
                    <li>PRO: Stone resists deforming, weathers the elements well, withstands fire and helps maintain
                        stable interior environments.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: Stone is challenging to quarry, and heavy to move, and it has tension and stress
                        limitations.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: If you do not build in close proximity to a quarry, the cost of transporting stone can be
                        very high. The cost of any repairs/renovations to the building is above average as well.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>CONCRETE</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO: Concrete is a versatile material that can be formed on the spot or poured into molds,
                        hardened and then transported.
                    </li>
                    <li>PRO: Reinforced concrete is adaptable, extremely strong and resistant to Mother Nature’s fury.
                        Reinforced concrete can be formed into many shapes with a supporting structure of narrow steel
                        rods embedded right in the concrete when it&#8217;s poured. Rebar reinforcement makes concrete
                        an ideal material for walls, beams, slabs, foundations, frames and many other applications- LIKE
                        HOMES!
                    </li>
                    <li>PRO: Concrete is a cost effective building material. The use of metal rods and mesh, together
                        with a relatively inexpensive concrete medium, make reinforced concrete a flexible, reliable and
                        economical building choice.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: Unless a coating of color or facing such as stucco is applied over it, concrete has an
                        industrial look that might not be appealing for some home builders.
                    </li>
                    <li>CON: Remodeling or renovating is not as easy as in a wood frame home unless it is accounted for
                        during the design phase of the building.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>And the winner is&#8230; CONCRETE!</p>
                <p><u>#1 Choice in Material for Bay Area Home Building</u></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With all of this information in mind, Concrete Shells made the easy decision to give this award to
                    Concrete. As a home building material, it is readily available to use, cost efficient, and creates
                    homes that are mother nature resistant, energy efficient and quiet. This is why a Concrete Shell is
                    built out of concrete and not one of the other materials listed. The benefits of concrete allow our
                    homes to have a permanence that is not possible in another style of home. A Concrete Shell will not
                    decay and will look great for decades with only minor maintenance, all thanks to concrete.</p>

            </description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you decide to go with a Concrete Shell, or another builder that offers
                insulating concrete forms, concrete masonry, aerated concrete, tilt-up concrete, or precast concrete, it
                is truly important to build your home out of concrete! Concrete homes of all types boast lower energy
                bills, more comfort and safety, plus less repair and maintenance over the increased lifespan of your
                home. Read on to learn more about why choosing a concrete home, means choosing sustainability.</p>
                <h3>Low Energy Bills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The thermal mass of the concrete decreases the passage of heat moving through the wall. Thus,
                        even with the same insulation, a concrete home will remain warmer in the winter and cooler in
                        the summer than the same wood-frame home.
                    </li>
                    <li>A Concrete Shell has no joints- this means ZERO air leakage! Other types of concrete homes also
                        do not have as many air leaks as a wood frame home. This will give your home an exceptional
                        R-value.
                    </li>
                    <li>REMEMBER: Air leakage accounts for a huge percentage of energy loss in the home! Therefore, a
                        concrete home = Decreased utility bills!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Increased Comfort and Safety</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All modern concrete home building systems offer increased comfort and quiet space.</li>
                    <li>Homes built from concrete eliminate chilly drafts, create consistent air temperatures, and
                        greatly reduce noises from the garbage truck or neighboring airport, to name a few.
                    </li>
                    <li>Concrete structures can stand up to everything Mother Nature throws at it significantly better
                        than a wood frame home. High wind, fire, flood, and earthquakes will have to work a lot harder
                        to take down a concrete home.
                    </li>
                    <li>Having less air leaks also means there are less opportunities for outside allergens to enter
                        your home. Say goodbye to stuffy noses!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Less Repair and Maintenance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A concrete wall cannot be dined on by pests like a wood frame home, therefore termites, rodents,
                        or ants cannot eat or reside in these walls.
                    </li>
                    <li>Concrete homes do not support the growth of mold, mildew and other potentially harmful
                        microorganisms.
                    </li>
                    <li>Concrete homes do not rot like wood and will not deteriorate in the same fashion or speed.</li>
                    <li>Wood requires extensive maintenance to avoid decay. Have you seen the Roman Colosseum? Concrete
                        can look nice for centuries!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Choosing concrete means choosing sustainability, but it also means choosing a healthier, more
                    advanced environment to live in. All concrete homes offer a variety of advantages unseen by a wood
                    frame home. Concrete Shells highly encourages you to look into these advantages further before
                    purchasing a wood frame home. Regardless of the builder, concrete homes pay contribution to a
                    sustainable planet and are a better investment in our ever evolving world.</p>
